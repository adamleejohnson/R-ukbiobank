\arguments{
\item{data}{The primary data frame.

This data frame includes all necessary columns required to perform look-ups (e.g. ICD10 code columns, medication code columns, age, sex, etc.).}

\item{codes}{Medication codes to look up}

\item{up_to_instance}{An integer or string specifying the instance number, or the <\code{\link[=dplyr_data_masking]{data-masking}}> name of the column containing instance numbers to use as the maximum allowed instance. Same syntax as \code{instance_num}, but used to include all data \emph{up to and including} the specified instance number.

The instance number is also known as the assessment visit number, of which there are 4 (labeled 0...3) in the UK BioBank study. This column does not exist in a standard distribution of the UKB data set, and should be defined and joined to the data set before performing analyses with this function.}

\item{medication_field}{e.g. \code{f.20003.0.0.Treatment_medication_code}}
